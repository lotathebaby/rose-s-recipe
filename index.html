    cups of flour. If dough is still sticky, add remaining<br>

over to fully cover the bowl with a clean dish towel and place<br>

dough into smooth ball.</li>
<li>Roll dough to 1.5cm inch thick. Cut out circles with a <br>
7.5cm cookie cutter, and holes with 2.5cm cookie cutter</li>
<li>Roll excess dough into a ball and roll again for additional <br>
doughnuts.</li>
<li>Preheat oven 200C</li>
<li>Place doughnuts onto a greased baking tray and place in a <br>
warm place until doubled in size. Bake doughnuts for 7-9 minutes<br>
, until golden brown.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Topping</h4>
<ol>
    <li>While doughnuts are baking, melt remaining margarine and <br>
    mix castor sugar and cinnamon together in a separate bowl</li>
    <li>Remove doughnuts from the oven and using tongs carefully<br>
    dip each one into the melted margarine and roll around to fully <br>
